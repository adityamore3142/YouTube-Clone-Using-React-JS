YouTube Clone - React Project

A fully responsive YouTube clone built using React.js, designed to mimic the UI and functionality of YouTube. This project demonstrates my proficiency with React hooks, routing, state management, API integration, and responsive design.

Dynamic Search & Video Fetching using the YouTube Data API v3
Video Listing by category (e.g., Music, Sports, News, etc.)
React Hooks mastered:

- `useState` – for managing component-level state
- `useEffect` – for side effects and data fetching
- `useParams` – for dynamic route parameters
  Props Management – clean parent-child communication
  Component Architecture – modular, reusable components
  Routing – implemented using React Router
  Responsive Design – mobile-first layout using Flexbox and CSS media queries
  Built first as a static website, then powered by dynamic API data
